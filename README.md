Final Project Repo Initiation (*to be updated) 

## Project title
Adulting 101 - a one stop shop for your basic adulthood needs. 

## Motivation
Our concept and idea was centered around the fact that a lot of young adults grew up in a school system that had defunded Home Economics. So, we have a generation who lack skills like: how to sew on a button, how to change a flat tire, etc, and who need to know those things on an immediate basis. Adulting 101 was pitched as a one-stop-shop for quick and easy to follow articles and how-to videos that would be vetted and curated based on need. So the content can be consumed in a very short amount of time, and then implemented in day to day life. The interface is created to be fun and accessible, with easy-to-navigate links and buttons.
